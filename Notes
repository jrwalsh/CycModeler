Compartment concerns: (http://ecocyc.org/PGDBConceptsGuide.shtml#node_sec_3.6)
  Example of an "S" type reaction -> PGLUCISOM-RXN
  Example of a "T" type reaction -> TRANS-RXN-94
  Example of a reaction occuring in multiple compartments -> RXN0-1483
  
  S types occur in only one compartment and have no values in the "RXN-LOCATIONS" slot, or exist in multiple or non-standard compartments and have value(s)
    that are children CCO-SPACE.  These values may be mapped to specific Enzyme Reactions with the "ENZRXNS" annotation.
  T types occur across at least 2 compartments.  The value in RXN-LOCATIONS is a child of CCO-MEMBRANE; annotations on the RXN-LOCATIONS values mapping
    CCO-IN, CCO-OUT, and possibly CCO-MIDDLE to children of CCO-SPACE.  This mapping can then be used to determine the space the metabolites exist in.
  
  An interesting example of a reaction which does not have any compartment information -> RXN0-5388
    It would seem that the members of the Electron-Transfer-Reactions class have reactant/product pairs that are "in the membrane"??? Since the membrane is
    not a child of space, no CCO-SPACE term is given.  This leads to the choice of assuming null compartment, default compartment, or making a new compartment
    for the membrane itself.
    
Protein based reaction not filtered by no protein reaction filter, gets through with no substrate or product

One of these reactions cannot be elementally balanced:
	Carnitine-CoA Ligase Reaction
	Equation: atp + coa + crn --> adp + crncoa + pi
	Gene: b0037

	Carnitine Degradation I
	Equation: atp + coa + crn --> amp + crncoa + ppi
	Gene: b0037
